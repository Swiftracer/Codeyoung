    <p><b>Elevator Ride - Jazz Genre</b></p>
    <audio controls>
    <source src="Elevator Ride.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>
    <p>The creator of <b>Elevator Ride</b> is <b>David Renda</b>. It is not a song at all, it was just a bunch of <u>elevator music combined</u> together. But when you really hear it, you will feel relaxed. Many of you may feel it sounds like music that plays while you are in the elevator (after all, the title of the song is named by it), but it is a very distinct type of <b>Jazz</b>.</p>

    <p><b>24K Magic - Reggae Genre</b></p>

    <p>You may know this better than the previous song, it is created by <b>Bruno Mars</b> after all. This artist released this song in <u>2016</u> in the <b>album of 24K Magic</b>. <b>Reggae</b> is not a genre many people know but here is a summed up definition of it. Reggae is a music genre that originated in <u>Jamaica in the late 1960s.</u> Reggae usually <u>relates news, social gossip, and political commentary.</u> If you are interested, you can find more about this in <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae">Wikipedia</a></b>.</p>
