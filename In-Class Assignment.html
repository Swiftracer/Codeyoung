            <p>Stephenie Meyer is an American novelist. She is best known for writing the vampire romance series Twilight, which has sold over 100 million copies, with translations into 37 different languages.Stephenie Meyer was born on December 24, 1973, in Hartford, Connecticut, the second of six children to financial officer Stephen Morgan and Candy Morgan, a homemaker.Meyer was raised in Phoenix, Arizona and attended Chaparral High School in Scottsdale, Arizona. In 1992, Meyer won a National Merit Scholarship, which helped fund her undergraduate studies at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, where she received a BA in English Literature in 1997. Although she began and finished her degree at BYU, she took classes at Arizona State University in fall 1996 and spring 1997. Meyer met her future husband, Christiaan "Pancho", in Arizona when they were both children. They married in 1994, when Meyer was 21. Together they have three sons. Christiaan Meyer, formerly an auditor, retired to take care of the children .Before writing her first novel, Twilight, Meyer had considered going to law school because she felt she had no chance of becoming a writer; she later noted that the birth of her oldest son Gabe in 1997 changed her mind, saying, "Once I had Gabe, I just wanted to be his mom." Before becoming an author, Meyer's only professional work was as a receptionist at a property company.</p>

        <p>Her most famous book series is the Twilight Series. I have actually read it and enjoyed it thoroughly. The whole series has been made into movies. But apart from Twilight, she has written a book called, <u>"The Host"</u>.</p>
