        <h1>Mikhail Varshavski</h1>
        <p>Mikhail Varshavski, or more commonly known as Dr. Mike, is my favorite celebrity. He is a family physician doctor or primary care physician at Chatham Family Medicene. He is currently a YouTuber too. He has influenced many people in many ways and continues to be a role model.</p>
        <p>In his videos, he does something related to medicene. One of my favorite type of his videos is medical meme reviews. He reviews medical memes and explains to us about it if we don't understand. In social media, he inspires and advises his followers to stay happy and healthy.</p>
        <p>One of the main reasons I chose him is because he explains medical knowledge without making it boring to the audience. Neither does he make it too geeky. He also has a really good sense of humour and I know you'll enjoy his videos too.</p>
