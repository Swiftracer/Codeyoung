It helps me get my mind off of things when I am stressed and helps me express my emotions. My favorite form of art is probably painting. Recently, my mom taught me how to glass paint. Right now, we are working on a glass painting of two birds.</p>

I love to cook, but my favorite form of cooking is baking. Recently, I made some chocolate brownies, and they were really tasty! Some of the things I watch are baking shows, how-to-cook videos, etc.</p>
